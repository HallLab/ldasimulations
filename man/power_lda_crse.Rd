\description{
Simulates data for \strong{time}, a time (in)variant
predictor \strong{x}, and a \strong{response} dependent
on both \strong{x}, \strong{time}, and their interaction.
Then applies various analytical methods, and
applies CRSE to a model of correct fixed effects.
}
\details{
\strong{Size of data:} Determined by number of samples
(clusters) and the number of waves (timepoints).

\strong{Time intervals:} Time is spaced in 1-unit
increments

\strong{Predictor variable:} The predictor \strong{x}
comes from a standard normal distribution.

\strong{Random effects:} Random effects define group
structure/dependency. Group-level/cluster-level
effects are Level 2 effects. Observation-level effects
are Level 1 effects. In longitudinal data, the "group"
is a single individual. The "observations" are the unique
measurements from a given individual at a given time.
This simulation only generates a random intercept (RI) per cluster
drawn from a normal distribution centered at 0 with
user-specified standard deviation. The greater the variance of
the Level 2 effects, relative to the Level 1 variation,
the more similar the values within a group.

\strong{Data generation:} Data is generated as a linear
combination of \code{x}, \code{time}, a random intercept (RI)
and individual level error (E). The relationship
between \code{y} and predictors \code{x} and \code{time}
can be linear or exponential.

\deqn{y = b0 + b1x + b2time + b3x*time + RI + E}
\deqn{y = b0 + e^{b1x + b2time + b3x*time} + RI + E}

The following methods are then applied to the data:

\strong{Naive linear regression (NLR):} Ignores clustering and time
when regressing outcome on predictor(s). The tested model
is \eqn{y = x}

\strong{Cluster robust standard error (CRSE):} Applies a CRSE correction
to the standard errors of GLM output. Clustering is the group
membership. The tested model is \eqn{y = x + time + x*time}

\strong{Linear mixed model (LMM):} Regresses outcome on the
predictor(s) and time, while accounting for group dependency
with random effects. The tested model is
\eqn{y = x + time + x*time + (1|group)}

To fit models, CRSE uses \code{lmtest} and the clustered variance
estimator from \code{sandwich} using type "HC1".
LMM uses \code{lmer} and \code{lmerTest}.

In randomly generated \code{x} has no variation instead of
reporting results for each method, the function returns a
data.frame with an error code \code{99999} as all entries
in the return value.
